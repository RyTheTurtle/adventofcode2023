# adventofcode2023
Advent of Code 2023 exercises. For this year, I'm learning Rust with these exercises.

## Problem Approaches
See [Solutions](./SOLUTIONS.md) for explanations of the approaches for each problem and how I arrived at the solution. 

## Running
Running `cargo run` in the root of this repository will execute successfully. If you choose to get the binary and run it elsewhere, the solutions are hardcoded to look for input files named with the scheme `<day>.<part>.txt` in the folder `.input`. As long as the input files are in the right place, you can run them with your own input.
